# Biography
## Who am I
My parents named me *Saurabh* and the family name that I inherited is 
*Sharma* ([__Saurabh Sharma__](https://about.me/samarthya)).As a wise man 
once told me

**Death is the only truth, __it gives purpose to life__. Every second counts, 
make sure you spend it wisely.**

I believe in trying, and living to the maximum. Every minute spent in 
past about things that could have been done, or should have been done 
is disrespect to the present.

## Profession
I am full time Software engineer, with more than 13 years of industry 
exposure. I am employed with [Pitney Bowes](http://www.pb.com) as a Development 
Manager. I started off with computers in my graduation days, against my 
parents wishes who wanted me to do something in the fields of Mathematics
or Physics; but I choose Computers. In those days it was a bit of craze
to even know how to work on a computer, and we started off on a x86 based
system doing PASCAL and COBOL.

### Personal
I was born in the late 70's to my lovely parents who needed a younger 
child to irritate their eldest son. Which I have been dutifully doing till
date. I am __married__ and have a lovely daughter who never ceases to 
test my patience, with her never ending energy and mischief. Sometimes I 
wonder is it karma, considering things I have done to my elder brother.
